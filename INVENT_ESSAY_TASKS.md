1. Assess the spatial occupation of the cat within the image. Determine what proportion of the total image area the cat physically inhabits. A cat that stretches across the majority of the frame is visually dominant and scores highly, while a cat that occupies only a small fraction of the image — tiny, distant, or lost in a vast scene — scores low. This is the foundational measurement of size-within-frame: how much visual real estate does the cat claim?

2. Evaluate the bodily completeness of the cat within the frame. Determine whether the cat's physical form is wholly contained within the boundaries of the image or whether significant portions have been cropped away. Look for whether key body parts — head, ears, torso, legs, paws, tail — are visible and intact. The ideal is a cat whose full body is generously contained with breathing room from the edges. At minimum, the face and upper body should be unclipped. Score highly when the cat appears whole and intact. Score low when aggressive cropping or poor framing fragments the cat, slicing away ears, truncating tails, or hiding limbs, leaving the viewer with a piece of a cat rather than a complete animal.

3. Judge the compositional substantiality of the cat as the subject of the image. Beyond raw area and physical intactness, determine whether the cat produces the holistic impression of being the weighty, anchoring subject of the photograph. A cat can be moderately sized and fully intact yet still feel insubstantial if it is dwarfed by overwhelming surroundings or positioned as an incidental element in a busy scene. Score highly when the cat's size and wholeness combine to produce a sense of visual authority — the cat is unmistakably the point of the image, demanding the viewer's attention through its sheer proportional presence. Score low when the cat, despite being present, feels like an afterthought rather than the commanding subject of the frame.
