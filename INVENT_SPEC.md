Evaluate the proportional presence of the cat in the image. Determine how much of the image's total area the cat occupies, and whether that occupation feels substantial and complete. A cat that fills most of the frame scores highly, while a cat reduced to a small speck in a vast scene scores low. Critically, this evaluation must account for completeness and wholeness: a cat whose full body — or at minimum its full face and upper body — is generously contained within the frame is more dominant than one so aggressively cropped that ears, paws, or tail are clipped away, leaving the viewer with the sense of a fragmented subject rather than a commanding one. The ideal proportional presence is a cat that fills the frame significantly with its whole form, feeling large in visual real estate without feeling incomplete. Score closer to 1 when the cat occupies a large share of the frame while appearing whole and intact. Score closer to 0 when the cat is tiny, distant, or so heavily cropped that it feels fragmented rather than present.
